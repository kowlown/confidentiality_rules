# Privacy policies

## Introduction
I'm not a lawyer, and I'm too poor to pay for one, but since it is mandatory to provide privacy policies, here they are.

## Why do I need data ?
I'm the owner of the application, since it's a small application I need to use some external tool to improve the quality of my application.
This tool only collect crashes and only the pertinents data allowing me to better understand what happened when there was a crash (Phone model, OS version, crash logs). 
The tool I use for this is the Crashlytics tool provided by Google with Firebase.

## Who have access to the data ?
- I don't collect data for marketing
- I don't sell your data.
- I don't even know who you are.
- Only me and of course, Google and the Firebase teams, have also access to the data since they provide the tool I use.


## Can you have access to the data ?
Since I don't own the tool Crashlytics I can't give a full access to the data. I don't even know for whom there was a crash, I only know there was a crash somewhere on a phone.
Therefore I encourage you to look for the tool Crashlytics.

## Why does the application need the camera ?
I use a QRCode to ease the pairing with the computer server. To scan a QRCode I need to use the camera, the other way would have to ask you to draw the QRCode on the screen, but I guess it would too tedious.
