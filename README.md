# Privacy policies

## Introduction
I'm not a lawyer, and I'm too poor to pay for one, but since it is mandatory to provide privacy policies, here they are.

## Why do I need data ?
I'm the owner of the application, since it's a small application I need to use some tools to improve the quality of my application.
These tools collect only crash and the only the pertinent data allowing me to better understand what happened when there was a crash (Phone model, OS version, crash logs). 
The tool I use for this is the Crashlytics tool provide by Google with Firebase.

## Who have access to my data ?
- I don't collect data for marketing
- I don't sell your data.
- I don't even know who you are.
- Only Google and the Firebase teams have also access to the data since they provides the tool I use.


## Can I have access to the data you have ?
Since I don't own the tool Crashlytics I can't give a full access to the data. I don't even know for whom there was a crash, I only know there was a crash somewhere on a phone.
Therefore I encourage you to look for the tool Crashlytics.
